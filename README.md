# ruby-ws

This is a workshop that I taught some initial concepts of the Ruby Language.

The main goal of this project is to help beginners in Ruby Language to learn
the basic syntax of this wonderful language, so there is not any advanced examples 
or exercises

The answers for all exercises can be find in the branch 'answers'

All exercises and examples were based on the following references:
